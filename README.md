**Abstract**

Skin disease diagnosis using AI holds promise for improving healthcare accessibility but faces challenges with non-dermoscopic image variability and fairness across skin tones.
This study proposes a methodology to preprocess images, classify skin tones using a tailored Individual Typology Angle approach, and train a neural network to diagnose 
nine conditions. Fairness is evaluated using metrics like Disparate Impact Ratio and Equalized Odds Ratio. Results reveal biases against darker skin tones, highlighting the need
for fairness-aware methodologies to ensure equitable AI-driven health-care solutions.
